### Hi there 👋🏾

- 🔭 I'm currently working on [Cox Automotive](https://coxautomotive.com.br/) as Senior Software Engineer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cloud computing in Azure and AWS
- 👯 I’m always looking for ways to share my knowledge and recently I’m writing them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@petersonzeferino)
- 💬 Ask me about Azure, AWS, .NET, Angular, React, Architecture, DDD, TDD and BDD (If you want to talk about another topic, I'll be very happy to learn with you).
