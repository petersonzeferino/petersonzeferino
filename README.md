### Hi there 👋🏾

<p>My name is Peterson Zeferino from Brazil (🇧🇷) and I'm passionate about solving problems using technology 😄</p>
 
- 🔭 I'm currently working on [HMH](https://www.hmhco.com) as Senior Software Developer
- 🌱 I'm currently improving my knowledge of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and learning [Lit](https://lit.dev)
- 👯 I’m always looking for ways to share my knowledge and recently I’m writing them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@petersonzeferino)
- 💬 Ask me about Azure, AWS, .NET, Angular, React, Architecture, DDD, TDD and BDD (If you want to talk about another topic, I'll be very happy to learn with you).

#### 📫 Would you like to find me?
